=== Description ===
Easy Video Reviews is the best and easiest video review plugin for WordPress, fully compatible with WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads plugins. Your customers can record and send video testimonials right from their browser, and you can manage and showcase anywhere on your WordPress website.

The plugin comes with the easiest Shortcode support that helps you to showcase awesome video review effortlessly with responsive and customizable styles on your website.

Suppose you want to buy a plugin. You’ve shortlisted a few options at 3 different websites. Which one will you choose? One with multiple customer reviews and testimonial videos showing the wonders you can do with the plugin? Or one with a vague ‘great plugin’ comment in the review section?

Most would choose the former, no matter how good the latter plugin might be. The thing is: people need reviews. They need the assurance by someone who has bought that product that it’s a good choice and that it’s worth spending their hard-earned money on.

This is where strong video reviews come into play!!💪

We all know a written review is easy to whip up. But what really worth and brings money for your business are the video testimonials. And we’ve got numbers to prove it:

💰 Generate 62% more revenue from every customer—not just once, but on every visit.

 When a consumer interacts with your video review, they are 58% more likely to convert.

👩‍💻 Video increases organic search traffic on a website by 157%. A website is 53 times more likely to reach the front page of Google if it includes video.

🧐 Video has a 95% retention rate, while people only remember 12% of textual information.


Websites of all the big platforms such as WooCommerce stores, Shopify stores, or any business that sell products - are built upon trust. No matter how good your product or service actually is, people who have never heard of your company will be initially skeptical until you've built some trust with them. You can spend a lot of time perfecting marketing and brand awareness content, but the most effective way these days is word of mouth from your happy customers🤗
